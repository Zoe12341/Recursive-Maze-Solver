This assignment was a bit tricky to start because I was confused on what an enum was. It took me a bit of time to get the hang of how to use an enum. Solving this assignment was very satisfying though, because the display window looked so nice. 

At first I thought I was doing the recursive step wrong because my maze would not display when I called that function. I spent a long time trying to figure out what was wrong (the TA was stumped too) before I realized my recursive function was right, I just wasn't updating my MazeContents correctly. I think I have a pretty good grasp on the concept of recursion now, and can definitly see how it is useful to use for stuf like this assignment. 

The hardest part turned out to be the last phase. I was unable to have my prgram read in user input using the '<' symbol. It was incompatible with how I had designed my Maze class. I went to TA office hours twice to work on it and both times the TAs weren't sure what to do.
