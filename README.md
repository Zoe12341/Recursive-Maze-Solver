# Recursive-Maze-Solver

A program for solving mazes using recursion that animates the solution of your maze.

This program is able to read maps in the following format. A valid input file will contain a character grid representing the maze. In this grid, a # represents a wall, and a . represents a passageway. A space character should also be interpreted as a passageway. The symbols S and F, respectively, represent the start and finish of the maze, and should appear exactly once. Here is an example of a simple 6x9 maze file:

#########
#S..#...#
#.#.#.#.#
#.###.#.#
#.....#F#
#########
